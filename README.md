get a better understanding of how i can retrieve information from a system,
to detect weird and malicious behaviors.

- C++/C (Windows API, WinSock and competitive coding)
- Java (plain java and SpringBoot framework)
- Python (Pygame, Django, Flask, embedded programming and networking)
- Dart (Flutter framework)
